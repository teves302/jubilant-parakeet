<h1 style="color:#714137; font-family:Times New Roman;" align="center">LANA DEL RAY</h1>
<h2 style="color:#935A4E"; align="center";> LANA DEL RAY IS MY TOP SINGER OF THE YEAR. Her voice is very angelic and calm, I have never heard any other artists that have the same vibe as her songs. She makes me feel confident and happy whenever I'm not in the mood and she won the Billboards Top 1 singer of the year 2023.</h2>

<h1 style="color:#714137; font-family:Times New Roman;" align="center">CONAN GRAY</h1>
<h2 style="color:#935A4E"; align="center";> Ever since March 2020, I would always repeat his song "Heather" because it was what kept me sane during quarantine. I did not like it because it became popular but I really loved his voice and the message of the song. </h2>

<h1 style="color:#714137; font-family:Times New Roman;" align="center">FAVORITE FOOD</h1>

<h1 style="color:#714137; font-family:Times New Roman;" align="center">SALMON</h1>
<h2 style="color:#935A4E"; align="center";> Salmon is a dish that isn't really liked by my peers, although I like the taste of the fresh fish, especially when it's coated with lemon juice. I prefer eating fish compared to other types of meat, and this would certainly be my favorite one. 

<h1 style="color:#714137; font-family:Times New Roman;" align="center">FAVORITE BOOK SERIES</h1>
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/f6/8e/2c/f68e2c750e8c9b37ac72bc0d3aac7096.jpg">
<h1 style="color:#714137; font-family:Times New Roman;" align="center">SHATTER ME</h1>
<h2 style="color:#935A4E"; align="center";> This is my favorite book series so far, other than the famous Harry Potter Series. This was written my a muslim author, tahereh Mafi in which the main character Juliette gets locked in an asylum. This may seem very weird but in the end, there's a plot twist that I wished I could read again.  I may be a very judgeful person when it comes to reviewing books, but this is a book series that I will always recommend.
